      "### 1. Chronic Disease Management\n",
      "- **Diabetes Care**: Continuously monitor glucose via wearables or implanted sensors, recommend insulin dose adjustments, diet, and exercise plans, and alert providers in case of hypoglycemia risk.\n",
      "- **Cardiovascular Diseases**: Track blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG data to predict potential events like arrhythmias or heart failure exacerbations and initiate preventive interventions.\n",
      "- **COPD and Asthma**: Monitor lung function indicators and environmental factors to prevent exacerbations by adjusting medication and lifestyle factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Medication Adherence and Management\n",
      "- Automatically remind patients to take medications.\n",
      "- Detect potential adverse drug interactions based on current profiles.\n",
      "- Propose adjustments or alerts for prescription refills and changes.\n",
      "- Coordinate with pharmacies and healthcare providers for smooth medication management.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Preventive Healthcare and Wellness Coaching\n",
      "- Create personalized lifestyle and nutrition plans based on continuous data streams and genetic predispositions.\n",
      "- Detect early symptoms or risk factors of chronic diseases.\n",
      "- Offer motivational nudges and behavioral change support to enhance patient engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Post-Operative and Rehabilitation Monitoring\n",
      "- Track recovery metrics and symptoms remotely.\n",
      "- Adjust rehabilitation plans dynamically based on patient progress.\n",
      "- Communicate with clinicians for timely interventions if complications arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Emergency Response and Early Warning Systems\n",
      "- Identify sudden drastic changes in patient vitals that may signal emergencies.\n",
      "- Decide when to alert emergency services or caregivers autonomously.\n",
      "- Optimize triage and urgent care decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. Care Coordination and Administrative Automation\n",
      "- Automatically schedule doctor visits, diagnostic tests, and follow-ups.\n",
      "- Manage insurance claims and approvals proactively.\n",
      "- Facilitate communication among multiple healthcare providers for holistic patient care.\n",

      "- Autonomously navigate complex healthcare workflows.\n",
      "- Make context-aware, real-time decisions, adapt to new data.\n",
